 # Array Basics

 In order to make our Game of Life simulation, we will first need to create a "palette" for the different kinds of `Characters` that the user will be able to place on the grid cells. We will be using a one-dimensional array to store this pallete.

 In many ways, you already know how to manipulate array variables. They behave similarly to normal variables. Shown below is a standard way to initialize an _empty_ array, using `let`.

 */

var palette: [Character] = ["😃","😜","😔"]

/*:

 - note: A `String` is made up of `Character`s. A `Character` is just a single element `String`! It cannot store more than one letter/number/special characters. An `Array` can hold any data type as long as every element in it is the same data type! We'll be working with `Array`'s holding `Character`s most of this playground.

 ## Declaring Arrays

 The _data type_ of this palette variable is `[Character]`. This translates to "an _array_ of _Characters_." You can make arrays of anything, including arrays of `String`s, arrays of `Int`s, or even arrays of _arrays of_ `Character`s (we'll get there soon).

 The `palette` variable is initialized to the empty array, denoted by `[]`. In order to represent a _literal representation_ of an array, you list 0 or more comma-separated values, enclosed within square brackets.

 - callout(Try it out): Try overwriting the empty array literal (right of the equals sign in the code above) with the array below. This represents three `Character` elements, enclosed within an array. Watch how the palette appears to reflect your changes!

    `["🐱", "😀", "😜"]`

 - important: You open up an emoji keyboard by pressing `control + command + space`. Do not forget the `"` around the emoji characters!

 ## Indexing

 Now that we have 3 elements the `palette` variable, how do we retrieve those elements? Enter the _subscript_ operator:

    palette[0]

 In order to retrieve an _element_ of an array, you _postpend_ the variable with brackets containing the _index_ number of the element you wish to retrieve.

 - important: Array indices start from 0 and end with 1 less than the number of elements in it!_ So in this example, `palette[1]` will return the _second_ element in the array, and `palette[3]` will yield an __error__.

 The below image shows how an example array might be initalized, with the indices to the elements shown above each cell:

 ![](array.jpg)

 */

let exampleArray = [2, 5, 1, 3, 4]
exampleArray[0]
exampleArray[1]
exampleArray[2]
exampleArray[3]
exampleArray[4]

/*:

 ## Subscript assignment

 - callout(Try it out): In addition to retrieving elements from the array, you can also assign to elements with the _subscript operator_. It looks exactly like a normal assignment statement.

    `palette[0] = "😜"`


 */



/*:

 ### That didn't work!

 The above code won't work without some changes, though.

 - important: We originally delcared the palette variable using `let`. This made it a constant or _immutable_ array. Just like normal `let` constants, if you create an array using `let`, you won't be able to change anything _inside_ it. In order to overcome this, change your `let` declaration to a `var`.

 Now, you can try setting element 0 of the array to 😜. The first and third elements of the array should now both be set to "😜".

 */
palette[0] = "😜"


/*:

 ## Appending

 What if you want to _insert_ an element, changing the size of an array? `palette[3] = "🐱"` won't work, since accessing an array beyond it's bounds causes an error. This is where `append()` comes in!


 - callout(Try it out): Try running this code.

    `palette.append("🐱")`

 Now, a new "🐱" character has been tacked on to the back of the array, and it's size has increased by one.

 - note: You can verify that the size of the array has changed, by checking its `count` property:

    `palette.count`

 This will return how many elements there are in the array. It'll come in handy later!

 Try it out in the working space below.

 */

palette.append("🐱")
palette.count


/*:

 - note: The syntax for getting the number of elements in an array is _not_ a function -- it doesn't have parenthesizes! `count` is a _property_ or variable that belongs to an array. You access it using _dot syntax_ as you saw above.

 ## For Loops

 So far, we've been operating on elements one at a time. What if we wanted to do the same operation multiple times, or wanted to replace the entire contents of the array? Re-enter the `for loop`... Do you remember it from `drawPolygon`?

    for index in 0..<5 {
        palette.append("😈")
    }

 */
for i in 0..<5 {
    palette.append("😈")
}



/*:

 If you run it, you'll see that _five_ new 😈's have been appended to the back of the array, meaning that the code in the curly brackets ran 5 times! This is the magic of the _for loop_.

 The above for loops, translated to English works as follows

 - Set `index` to 0
 - While `index` is _less than_ 5, run the enclosing code. After each run, _increment_ the `index` variable by 1

 The variable `index` in this example was set to `0` on the first iteration, `1` in the next iteration, and so on... This might prove useful!

 - important: Did you spot the difference from last time we used `for-loops`? This time we have a counter variable called `index`. We are also starting at `0` and using `..<` instead of `...` -- `..<` means up to _but not_ including the final number while `...` means up to _and including_ the final number. You can read `0..<5` as _zero to five non-inclusive_. `0...5` reads as _zero to five inclusive_.

 
 - callout(Try it out): Remember `palette.count`? It told us how many elements there are in the array. Let's try replacing 5 with that, and use the _subscript assignment_ operator to set the element corresponding to that index with 👾.

 */
for index in 0..<palette.count {
    palette[index] = "👾"
}


/*:

 Congrats, you've learned how to set all the elements to a new value!

 ## More for-loops

 Here are more variations on the for loop you just learned.

    for index in 0...5 {
        // do something
    }

 This version of the for loop uses `...` instead of the `..<` found previously. This means that the for loops from 0 to 5, _inclusively_ – that is, _including_ the 5. That means that the loop will iterate for a total of 6 times!

 - important: Be careful when using `...` to iterate over arrays. Array indices always go from 0 to _1 less than_ the `count` of the array. So the following code would cause an __error__:

        for index in 0...palette.count {
            palette[index] = "😈"
        }

 ## for-in loops

 So far we've been iterating with for loops using integers, but you can actually use arrays directly to retrieve all the elements of the array:

    for element in palette {
        // element is now a variable containing a Character
        // loop code here
    }

 This is equivalent to:

    for index in 0..<palette.count {
        let element = palette[index]
        // loop code here
    }

 - note: We will not be using this syntax right now since we need the index of the array in order to update the elements, but this might be useful in the future.
